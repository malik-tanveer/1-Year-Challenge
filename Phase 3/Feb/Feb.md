# **Phase 3 — Month 1: February Roadmap (Three.js Basics + 3D Web Projects)**

**Goal:** Learn Three.js foundations, 3D scenes, models, lights, camera, interaction & animations

**Duration:** Feb 1 — Feb 28  
**Outcome:**
- 🎨 3D Portfolio Section (Hero / 3D Scene)
- 📦 3D Product Viewer (Model + Controls + Interaction)

---

## 🗓️ **Week 1 — Three.js Foundations (Feb 1–7)**

**Focus:** Core concepts — Scene, Camera, Renderer, Geometry, Materials

| Day | Topics | Tasks / Practice |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| 1 | What is Three.js | Setup project (Vite/React/Vanilla), add Three.js, render blank canvas |
| 2 | Scene + Camera + Renderer | Create scene, perspective camera, renderer, append canvas to DOM |
| 3 | Geometry + Mesh | Add box/sphere, apply basic material, position objects |
| 4 | Animation Loop | Create render loop, rotate cube, requestAnimationFrame |
| 5 | Coordinates & Transformations | Translate, scale, rotate objects; understand axes |
| 6 | OrbitControls | Add camera controls (zoom / pan / rotate) |
| 7 | Practice Review | Build mini scene with 2–3 shapes + animation |

**Mini Project:** Simple animated 3D scene (shapes + orbit controls)

---

## 🗓️ **Week 2 — Lighting, Textures & Models (Feb 8–14)**

**Focus:** Realistic visuals + importing 3D models

| Day | Topics | Tasks / Practice |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| 8 | Lights Basics | Ambient + Directional + Point lights; shadow intro |
| 9 | Shadows & Materials | Enable shadows, Standard/Phong materials |
| 10 | Textures | Load texture images (color, roughness, normal basic) |
| 11 | GLTF / GLB Models | Import model using GLTFLoader |
| 12 | Positioning & Scaling Models | Place model in scene with correct proportions |
| 13 | Model Optimization | Reduce poly, compress textures, control FPS |
| 14 | Week Review | Build small scene with imported model + lighting |

**Mini Project:** 3D Object Showcase (model + lights + orbit)

---

## 🗓️ **Week 3 — Interaction, Animation & 3D Product Viewer (Feb 15–21)**

**Focus:** User interaction + product experience

| Day | Topics | Tasks / Practice |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| 15 | Raycasting (Click Objects) | Detect clicks / hover on 3D objects |
| 16 | UI + 3D Sync | Change material / color via UI buttons |
| 17 | Animations | Keyframe / GSAP basic object animations |
| 18 | Camera Transitions | Smooth camera movement to focus object |
| 19 | Model Variants | Switch between multiple models / parts |
| 20 | Build Product Viewer | Combine controls + animations + UI |
| 21 | Testing & Polish | Mobile controls, resize handling, performance test |

**Mini Project:** **3D Product Viewer** (click, rotate, change colors)

---

## 🗓️ **Week 4 — Portfolio Integration + Final Project (Feb 22–28)**

**Focus:** Integrate Three.js into real website + final project build

| Day | Topics | Tasks / Practice |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| 22 | Three.js in React / Next (optional) | Canvas component, layout integration |
| 23 | 3D Portfolio Hero Section | Add animated 3D scene to portfolio page |
| 24 | Performance Optimization | Texture compression, light limits, render loop tuning |
| 25 | Loading Experience | Use loading manager + progress UI |
| 26 | Accessibility & UX | Fallback for low‑end devices, toggle 3D on/off |
| 27 | Final Build & Export | Prepare final project build |
| 28 | Review + Upload | Push to GitHub + add screenshots + live demo |

**Final Outputs:**
- 3D Portfolio Section (interactive scene)
- 3D Product Viewer App
- Clean, optimized Three.js project structure

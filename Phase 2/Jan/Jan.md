# **Phase 2 — Month 3: January Roadmap (Docker + Deployment + CI/CD)**

**Goal:** Dockerize MERN apps, deploy professionally, automate builds & improve production quality
**Duration:** 31 Days (Jan 1 – Jan 31)
**Outcome:**
✔ Dockerized MERN App
✔ Deployed Backend + Frontend
✔ CI/CD Basic Pipeline
✔ Production-ready workflow

---

##  **Week 1 — Deployment & Environment Setup (Jan 1–7)**

*(Short — only essentials, since you already practiced before)*

**Focus:** Production build, ENV handling, deploy live

| Day | Topics                     | Tasks / Practice                                |
| --- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | ENV Files & Config Cleanup | Move secrets to `.env`, config folder structure |
| 2   | Production Build (React)   | `npm run build`, serve static files             |
| 3   | Deploy Backend             | Deploy Express API → Render / Railway / Vercel  |
| 4   | Connect MongoDB Atlas      | Test live DB + API routes                       |
| 5   | Deploy Frontend            | Netlify / Vercel, connect to live API           |
| 6   | CORS & URL Fixing          | Debug API calls, env URLs, HTTPS issues         |
| 7   | Full App Test (Live)       | Test Auth + CRUD + Uploads on production        |

**Mini Output:**
**MERN Blog Live — Frontend + Backend + DB Working**

## **Week 2 — Docker Fundamentals (Jan 8–14)**

**Focus:** Learn Docker from zero → run backend & DB in containers

| Day | Topics                       | Tasks / Practice              |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 8   | What is Docker & Images      | Install Docker, basic CLI     |
| 9   | Dockerfile for Backend       | Create image for Express API  |
| 10  | Containers & Ports           | Run backend container locally |
| 11  | MongoDB in Docker            | Run Mongo container + volume  |
| 12  | Connect API → Mongo (Docker) | Update connection strings     |
| 13  | Docker Compose Intro         | Create `docker-compose.yml`   |
| 14  | MERN API + DB via Compose    | Run both services together    |

**Mini Project:**
**Dockerized Backend + Mongo (Compose Setup)**

| 16  | React Build in Docker  | Dockerfile for frontend               |
| 17  | Nginx Intro (Optional) | Serve React build via Nginx container |
| 18  | Multi-Container MERN   | Frontend + Backend + DB               |
| 19  | Volumes & Bind Mounts  | Persistent DB + dev workflow          |
| 20  | Rebuild & Versioning   | Rebuild images, tagging               |
| 21  | Local Production Test  | Run whole app via Docker only         |

**Mini Project:**
**Full MERN App in Docker (Frontend + Backend + Mongo)**
